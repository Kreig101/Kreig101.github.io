I came from a medical background where I was doing medical coding.
Not the same as what I am studying now for, which is software engineering. It was more literal coding based off a doctorâ€™s diagnosis of a patient. I've been medical codinglfor about 7 years now, so I'm use to reading through technical wording for the most part. So the reading aspect I was use too. 

However, the in detail technicality definitely through me for a loop at first. It took me a while to grasp what was happening, but once I started to get the hang of how to "think outside the box" per se, everything coding wise started to open up. I'm sure everyone going through the motions of tackling this will feel the same way. Really looking forward to continuing these lessons.
